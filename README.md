# 🔐 Random & Pseudo-Random Key Selection System

Welcome to the **Random & Pseudo-Random Key Selection System** – a Python-based encryption utility designed to explore and implement random and pseudo-random key generation for cryptographic applications.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a foundational approach to selecting cryptographic keys using both random and pseudo-random techniques. It helps highlight the difference between secure key generation strategies in encryption systems and provides a hands-on tool for experimentation.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎲 **Random Key Generation** using Python's `secrets` module
- 🤖 **Pseudo-Random Key Generation** with seed-based `random` module
- 🔍 Clearly shows the contrast in behavior between the two
- 📂 File-based input and output support for key handling
